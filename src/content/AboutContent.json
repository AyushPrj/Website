  "text": "I was the lead developer of a team creating an arcade-style game using a microcontroller. I was in charge of designing and implementing the game logic, creating the graphics, and executing the sound mechanism in the system. The program utilized a combination of timers, IRQâ€™s, GPIO, SPI, DAC, etc. I also helped with the hardware component, designing the circuit schematic, prototyping the design on a breadboard, and helping manufacture the PCB.",
