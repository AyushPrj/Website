  "text": "I pride myself on my desire to learn and solve problems. At Purdue University, I am doing just that as an undergraduate student in my senior year as a computer engineer.\n\nThe invaluable time I have spent on various engineering teams has allowed me to become adept at planning, coordinating, and executing a team's vision. My strong desire to learn new skills has led me to branch out into fields such as data science, consulting, backend development, frontend development, machine learning, and embedded systems. Because of that same desire, I have also developed programming skills in C++, C, Go, Python, MATLAB, Java, HTML, CSS, Verilog, Assembly, JavaScript, and TensorFlow.\n\nI am looking forward to utilizing my skills tp make a meaningful impact on the world once I graduate!",
